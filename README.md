## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had to remove the Learn More button from the regular flow of the page and position it in absolute because in some cases of responsiveness if 1 or 2 out of the 3 paragraphs would go to the next line before the other ones the buttons would stop being alligned next to each other.
I could have used grid and set all the buttons to the same row, i dont know which way is better.
